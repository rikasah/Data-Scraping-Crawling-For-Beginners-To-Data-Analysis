# Data Scraping Crawling For Beginners To Data Analysis

If we work in data science or a related field, we probably have heard this quote before: “Data is The New Oil.” 
The quote goes back to 2006, and is credited to Mathematician Clive Humby, but has recently picked up more steam after the Economist published a 2017 report titled “The world’s most valuable resource is no longer oil, but data”. 

Why is data so important to us? Because with data, we can see various trends, predict a phenomenon in the future and even as a consideration in making decisions.
Scraping is one of the well-known ways of retrieving and digging up data. Web scrapping is the process of extracting data from a website. By mastering these techniques, collecting data is no longer a difficult obstacle for us.

Seeing this opportunity, the DQLab x Digital Talent Scholarship Kominfo provided training on Web Scraping and Wrangling in its syllabus.
Lastly, I would like to say thank you for the opportunity that given by DQLab x DTS to me to be a presenter on the training with theme “Data Scraping & Crawling For Beginners To Data Analysis” in the Thematic Academy training series.
